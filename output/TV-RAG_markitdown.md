Abstract
Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as
the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted
with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal win-
dows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic
shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream
text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level
lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among
visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations,
we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples tem-
poral alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-
video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms:
(i) a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal off-
sets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries
according to their true multimedia context; and (ii) an entropy-
weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-
dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representa-
tiveness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together,
TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted
onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting
system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and con-
sistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-
video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench,
confirming the effectiveness of our model. The code can be found

1 Introduction
Recent breakthroughs in large-scale language modelling have catal-
ysed rapid progress in multimodal research, ultimately leading to
a new class of Large Video–Language Models (LVLMs) [11, 16, 37].
Despite their impressive accuracy on short, clip-length inputs, cur-
rent LVLMs still face significant obstacles when tasked with ana-
lyzing and reasoning over very long videos.

Recent attempts to improve long-horizon reasoning in Large
Video Language Models, exemplified by LongVA [39] and LongLLAVA
[35], have largely focused on widening the context window. LongVA,
for instance, simply scales up the token capacity to ingest more
frames. This brute-force expansion, however, proves brittle when
faced with out-of-distribution footage: the Video-MME benchmark
shows its accuracy drops sharply as additional frames are supplied.
A parallel research thread employs Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion (RAG) to supplement video queries with externally retrieved
documents [15, 18, 40]. Yet, treating the video stream purely as
text ignores vital visual alignment cues, and the reliance on high-
capacity LVLM backbones translates into steep computational costs
and poor adaptability. Consequently, existing RAG pipelines strug-
gle to capture the intertwined temporal and semantic signals re-
quired for truly robust long-video understanding.

Based on the considerations above, we focus on the following
question: Can we develop a new model that can tackle the video
RAG task from both temporal and semantic perspectives in a unified
training-free framework?

Motivated by this limitation, several studies [15, 18, 40] advocate
replacing the bulky chain of visual tokens with proxy captions dis-
tilled directly from the video stream via off-the-shelf optical char-
acter recognitions (OCR), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and
object-detection models. These auxiliary texts are tightly coupled
to the visual scene and inject complementary cues unavailable in
raw pixels. For instance, Long-context LVLMs extend visual tokens
so the model sees every frame, yielding strong temporal awareness
but at the cost of heavy retraining and limited semantic depth. GPT-
based agent pipelines first convert videos into textual reports, then

• To handle semantic drift and maintain temporally coherent
retrieval, we introduce a temporal-window BM25 retriever
that ties lexical relevance to timestamp alignment across
auxiliary text streams, supplying the LVLM with context
that stays synchronized with the evolving video content, all
without modifying model weights.

• Extensive experiments on several well-established bench-
marks show that TV-RAG achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance and outperforms other models. It can also be used as
a plug-in for other models.

2 Related Work
2.1 Large Language Models for Video
The surge of large language models has sparked parallel efforts to
craft versatile video–language systems. Early work, Video-ChatGPT
[20], processes frames separately and later fuses their representa-
tions via spatial–temporal pooling. VideoChat [10] augments ap-
pearance embeddings with on-the-fly textual captions to form a
richer clip encoding. To minimise the gap between image and video
pathways, Video-LLaVA [12] introduces a shared projector that
aligns both outputs within a common language latent space. Its
successor, LLaVA-NeXT-Video [40], adapts the LLaVA-NeXT back-
bone [15] through targeted video fine-tuning. Despite these ad-
vances, retrieval-augmented schemes such as Video-RAG [18] still
fall short in tracking the subtle temporal dependencies and layered
semantics present in lengthy, information-dense footage.

2.2 Large Language Models for Long-context

Video

A prominent strand of recent work attempts to enlarge the effec-
tive context window so that models can reason over intricate video
narratives. LongVA [39] and Long-LLaVA [35] pursue this goal
by first pre-training language backbones on massive text corpora,
banking on the resulting long-sequence handling skills to trans-
fer to video tasks. In contrast, INTP [27] rearranges the incoming
video tokens without any additional training, stretches the win-
dow of an LVLM to ingest far more visual information. Yet, these
solutions confront a familiar trade-off: every extra batch of sam-
pled frames inflates computation while delivering only marginal
gains. Because videos contain significant redundancy, and model
capacity is finite. Under these circumstances, most models cannot
achieve satisfactory performance.

2.3 Video Understanding by GPT-based Agent
A complementary line of work investigates using an LLM as a con-
troller that calls external vision or audio modules to parse long-
form video data, especially for question–answering tasks [5, 21, 29,
32, 36]. MM-VID [13] advances this idea by explicitly pairing each
frame with its textual caption, whereas VLog [14] first extracts
audio and appearance cues via multimodal pre-training and then
distills them into compact textual surrogates. Agent-style frame-
works such as VideoAgent [2], DrVideo [19], and OmAgent [38]
go a step further, issuing adaptive queries to retrieve relevant seg-
ments before reasoning over them. Despite their ingenuity, these
pipelines still suffer from two practical drawbacks: (i) iterative tool

temporal-aware, semantic-aware, and training-free pipeline
that is easily compatible with any LVLM.

query a proprietary LLM such as GPT-4o; while semantically pow-
erful, they lose fine-grained temporal cues and depend on closed-
source services. Yet, the strategy leaves two key issues unresolved:
C1 Cross-modal dependencies among images, audio, and subti-
tles remain implicit, hampering performance on tasks that
demand joint reasoning over long temporal spans;

C2 The fixed context window still cannot follow subtle seman-
tic drifts that emerge gradually throughout lengthy footage.
To this end, we introduce TV-RAG, a novel framework designed
to enhance the comprehension of long videos in LVLMs without
requiring additional training. Specifically, to address (C1), TV-RAG
employs a semantic entropy-based weighting strategy for key frame
selection to evenly distribute selected frames across time, reducing
redundancy, enhancing representativeness, and prioritizing the most
informative frames. To tackle (C2), it incorporates a temporal window-
based BM25 model that integrates time-aligned auxiliary data, in-
cluding OCR, ASR, and object detection (DET) outcomes. This ap-
proach enhances the relevance of text queries by aligning them
with the temporal context of multimedia content, ensuring that re-
trieved information is contextually appropriate.

By combining explicit temporal order with entropy-based se-
mantic salience, TV-RAG enables a two-stage reasoning process
that removes noise and filters out irrelevant content from long
videos. The module is lightweight and can be added to any exist-
ing LVLM without modifying its weights. This plug-and-play de-
sign allows TV-RAG to outperform popular models on benchmark
datasets such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. We
further evaluate TV-RAG on six widely used open-source LVLM
backbones, confirming its effectiveness.

In summary, our contributions are three-fold:

• To mitigate frame redundancy and preserve cross-modal se-
mantics in long videos, we propose TV-RAG, including a
semantic-entropy key-frame selector that computes multi-
modal information gain and enforces uniform temporal cov-
erage, yielding compact yet representative frame sets for
downstream LVLM reasoning.

MM’25, October 27–31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland

Figure 2: The illustration of our framework TV-RAG. The pipeline begins with query decoupling, where the LVLM rewrites
the user question into an explicit evidence-retrieval request, cleanly separating search from reasoning. TV-RAG then executes
three tightly coupled steps: (i) a semantic-entropy selector distills high-information frames across visual, OCR, ASR and de-
tection streams; (ii) a temporal-decay BM25 retriever ranks auxiliary texts by both lexical relevance and timestamp proximity,
ensuring chronological coherence; and (iii) a bi-level reasoning routine drafts and self-verifies the answer using the retrieved
evidence. By closing the loop between asking, retrieving, and reasoning without altering LVLM weights, TV-RAG simultane-
ously sharpens retrieval precision and elevates answer faithfulness.

invocation inflates inference latency, and (ii) many rely on closed-
source models, limiting both efficiency and the ease with which the
community can replicate results using purely open-source stacks.
Moreover, there are also some advanced methods, such as [18];
however, they have flaws in capturing the joint associations of tem-
poral and semantic information. In this way, it is still an open issue
to be addressed.

Problem Setup. Let V be an input video. We then use a frame–
selection unit to extract 𝑁 representative images F Each frame is
then mapped into a visual embedding via a frozen image encoder,
e.g., CLIP-L [23], yielding F𝑣 from F . Finally, the visual tokens F𝑣
and a user query Q are supplied to a large video–language model
to generate the answer O:

O = LVLM(F𝑣, Q).

(1)

3 Methodology
We introduce TV-RAG, a novel training-free process designed for
LVLMs that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing LVLM.
As shown in Fig. 2, the process consists of three main phases: (i) Se-
mantic entropy-based information extraction: After obtain-
ing the query, information is extracted based on semantic entropy
from different sources. (ii) Temporal decay-enhanced retrieval
model: In order to capture the important temporal information
in the video, the time window mechanism request is introduced
for obtaining the relevant information. (iii) Context-enhanced
reasoning-based response generation: In this final stage, the
auxiliary text retrieved based on the context-enhanced reasoning
mechanism is integrated with the user’s query and fed into the
LVLM to generate the final output.

In this way, we complete the RAG process for videos.
Two-stage Processes. In this paper, motivated by previous efforts
[12, 18], upon receiving a user’s query regarding a video, the LVLM
follows a two-phase process. First, the LVLM decouples the query
to generate structured retrieval requests, which serve as auxiliary
inputs for later stages. In this phase, the LVLM focuses solely on
processing textual data without access to the video frames. These
requests are then parsed, and if any category does not require data,
it will be marked as NULL (indicating no need for that specific
request). This results in the structured retrieval requests, R = {R𝑖 },
which means the request categories, such as detection information.
Then, they are passed on to the next phase. The process can thus
be decoupled into two main stages, as formalized in the following
equations:

R = LVLM(P, Q), R = {R𝑖 },

(2)

MM’25, October 27–31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland

Zongsheng Cao et al.

where P is the prompt. In the second phase, these requests, R, along
with the video frames, F𝒗, are used to generate the final output:

O = LVLM(F𝒗, Q, R).

(3)

In this phase, the LVLM processes the video frames, utilizes the
textual query, and incorporates the generated retrieval requests to
provide a more informed and contextually relevant answer.

3.1 Semantic Entropy-based Extraction
Auxiliary‐Text Extraction and Retrieval. Following the blue-
print laid out by recent retrieval-augmented systems [15, 18, 40],
we first transcribe the raw video into several complementary text
channels and then fetch the portions most useful for the down-
stream LVLM. Formally, we create a set R = { R𝑎𝑠𝑟 , R𝑜𝑐𝑟 , R𝑑𝑒𝑡 },
where (i) 𝑟asR is automatic speech recognition to harvest dialogue
or soundtrack content; (ii) 𝑟det is salient entities present on screen;
and (iii) 𝑟ocR is optical character recognition to capture any scene
text.

Longer clips naturally produce voluminous and often redundant
token streams, while the context budget of current open-source
LVLMs remains tight. To avoid overflow, we retrieve only those
snippets that align semantically with the user query. Before re-
trieval, three modality-specific repositories are built in parallel from
the video itself: an ASR base DasR, an OCR base DocR, and an
object-detection base Ddet. Subsequent look-ups are executed against
these lightweight databases, ensuring that irrelevant tokens do not
enter the LVLM’s limited context window.
Building Retrieval Repositories. Open source LVLMs tend to
misread scene text and spoken words, falling short of their propri-
etary counterparts. To curb such hallucinations and exploit frame
content more effectively, we offload text extraction to specialist
models. Concretely, EasyOCR [7] is run on each key frame to har-
vest on-screen captions, giving a pool of strings TocR; meanwhile,
the soundtrack is transcribed by Whisper [24], yielding an ASR
transcript TasR as advocated in prior work [15, 18, 40]. Both text
streams are embedded with the ContRieveR encoder [6] to ob-
tain dense vectors, which are written to two separate FAISS in-
dices [8]: DocR for scene text and DasR for speech. This design en-
ables low-latency, similarity-based retrieval of the most relevant
snippets during query time.
Key–Frame Selection. Although modern LVLMs excel at recog-
nising objects, they remain error-prone when asked to count in-
stances, pinpoint locations, or reason about complex interactions,
frequently hallucinating details when contextual cues are sparse.
To curb this issue, motivated by [12, 18], we rank every sampled
frame F = {𝐹𝑡 } by the semantic affinity between the detector re-
quest 𝑅𝑑𝑒𝑡 and the frame content, modulated by a temporal impor-
tance weight:

n

(cid:12)
(cid:12) 𝛼𝑡 · CLIP

(cid:0)
𝑅𝑑𝑒𝑡 , 𝐹𝑡

(cid:1)

o

≥ 𝜏

,

𝐹𝑘𝑒𝑦 =

𝐹𝑡

Object detection is then run only on this entropy-aware subset
FKey, ensuring that the LVLM processes the most informative and
contextually relevant frames.

The weight 𝑤𝑡 assigned to each frame is determined by the infor-
mation entropy 𝐻 (𝐹𝑡 ), a measure of the uncertainty or variability
within the frame’s content. Then the entropy 𝐻 (𝐹𝑡 ) is computed
as:

𝐻 (𝐹𝑡 ) = −𝑝𝑡 log 𝑝𝑡,

𝑝𝑡 =

˝

CLIP similarity(𝑅det, 𝐹𝑡 )
𝑗 CLIP similarity(𝑅det, 𝐹 𝑗 )

,

(4)

where 𝑝𝑡 represents the normalized similarity between the object
retrieval query and each frame 𝐹𝑡 , and 𝐻 (𝐹𝑡 ) captures how much
variance exists in the content of a given time segment. The se-
lection process begins by computing the CLIP similarity [23] be-
tween an object retrieval query R𝑑𝑒𝑡 and the sampled video frames
F. High entropy values indicate significant changes in the visual
or auditory content, suggesting that this segment contains crucial,
non-redundant information.

RemaRK. In this way, it ensures that time segments with higher
variability in content are more likely to be selected, while segments
with low variability (i.e., those that are redundant) are deprioritized.
The goal is to maximize the representativeness of the selected frames
and minimize redundant or irrelevant content, which is particularly
important in the context of long-duration videos. By incorporating
this entropy-based weighting mechanism, we ensure that critical mo-
ments in the video, which may involve sudden shifts in object inter-
action or scene changes, are not overlooked.

3.2 Temporal Window-based Text Retrieval
Query–Aware Retrieval. Our pipeline introduces a dedicated re-
trieval routine that tightly couples the user prompt with the auxil-
iary captions mined from the video. Inspired by prior multimodal
RAG work [12, 18], we begin by converting the query into a dense
representation e𝑟𝑒𝑞 using the Contriever encoder.

To prevent the common temporal drift problem, where a lexi-
cally relevant caption is drawn from an incorrect moment in the
clip, we refine the top-𝑘 text hits with a temporal re-ranking stage.
Each candidate’s score is updated by a weighted sum of its lexical
similarity to e𝑟𝑒𝑞 and its time-stamp distance from the query seg-
ment, ensuring the final selection is both semantically pertinent
and temporally on point.
Temporal Re-scoring of Retrieved Snippets. Assume that a
FAISS search over the OCR/ASR indices yields the relevant snip-
pets C. Let 𝜏𝑞 ∈ R mark the moment in the video that anchors the
user’s query, and denote by 𝜏𝑖 the original time-code of snippet 𝑐𝑖 .
We refine each snippet’s lexical BM25 score by a time-aware decay:

˜𝑠𝑖 =

BM25(ereq, 𝑐𝑖 ) 𝑒 −

˝

2
𝑘=0

𝜆𝑘 |𝜏𝑘

𝑞 −𝜏𝑖 |

BM25(ereq, 𝑐 𝑗 ) 𝑒 −

˝

2
𝑘=0

𝜆𝑘 |𝜏𝑘

𝑞 −𝜏 𝑗 |

3𝐾(cid:213)

𝑗=1

,

(5)

where 𝜏 is a similarity threshold. The weight 𝛼𝑡 captures how much
new information the segment contributes and is computed from
the normalised Shannon entropy of its visual features:

𝛼𝑡 =

˝

𝐻 (𝐹𝑡 )
𝑗 𝐻 (𝐹 𝑗 )

.

where ereq is the Contriever embedding of the query and 𝜆 > 0
(set to 1 in our study) controls the strength of the temporal penalty.
Here the three anchor points 𝜏𝑘
𝑞 is
the time-code of the last video frame, 𝜏 1
𝑞 marks the first frame, and
𝜏 2
𝑞 corresponds to the frame whose local context is semantically
most similar to the query. The rationale is that salient evidence can

𝑞 serve complementary roles: 𝜏 0

MM’25, October 27–31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland

appear near a video’s conclusion (e.g., a reveal or punch-line), at
its outset (introductory setup), or at an unpredictable location that
is best located via semantic affinity. By injecting all three anchors
into the exponential decay, the rescoring scheme remains agnostic
to where the key information actually lies, yet still rewards snip-
pets clustered around whichever temporal region proves relevant
for the user’s request.

The exponential term softly favours snippets that occur near 𝜏𝑘
𝑞
while still allowing distant, but lexically pertinent candidates to
survive with a lower confidence. Finally, we keep the top-𝐾 snip-
pets with the highest ˜𝑠𝑖 :

Level-2: Query-enhanced Latent Reasoning. Recognizing that
retrieved evidence may still omit latent or abstract concepts im-
plied by the user’s query, we introduce a generation-based aug-
mentation step. Instead of compressing auxiliary data, we instruct
the LVLM to perform two complementary operations: (1) generate
general background context relevant to the query to enrich model-
level knowledge grounding; (2) reformulate the user query into a
set of semantically similar paraphrases to enhance retrieval sensi-
tivity and decoding diversity.

Specifically, we define the prompt 𝐼𝑔𝑒𝑛 to guide context genera-

tion as:

(cid:0)
C = TopK

C, ˜𝑠𝑖

(cid:1)

.

(6)

Given a question, first generate a helpful background
context. Then, provide 2-3 alternative phrasings
of the question with similar meaning.

Incorporating timestamp proximity into the similarity score reme-

dies two chronic weaknesses of standard retrieval pipelines. (i) It
sharply reduces the likelihood of selecting passages that look se-
mantically relevant yet come from the wrong moment in the footage,
a pitfall common to long videos with recurrent motifs. (ii) It main-
tains chronological consistency for the LVLM, so downstream rea-
soning and text generation remain anchored to the correct slice
of the narrative. Unlike hard sliding windows or ad-hoc alignment
rules, the proposed weighting scheme is continuous, differentiable,
and plug-compatible with existing multimodal retrieval frameworks.
Object Information Retrieval. After retrieving the relevant in-
formation A, the next step involves extracting object-related infor-
mation stored in the auxiliary database. Motivated by [15, 18, 40],
object detection models typically produce raw outputs that include
spatial attributes in the form of bounding boxes and other informa-
tion. These components collectively form a structured scene graph,
expressed as Ast, which can be regarded as a detection database and
enhances the ability of LVLMs to interpret temporal and spatial in-
formation. By incorporating this structured graph representation,
we enable LVLMs to reason over the spatial layout and temporal
dynamics of objects within the video.

3.3 Context-augmented Reasoning with Query

Reformulation

While retrieved auxiliary signals (e.g., OCR, ASR) can provide es-
sential external context, relying exclusively on these sources in-
troduces two key limitations: (i) they are often noisy, fragmented,
or partially misaligned with the user’s underlying intent; and (ii)
compressing them to fit the limited context window of LVLMs may
introduce semantic loss and degrade the coherence of downstream
reasoning.

To overcome these issues, we propose a context-augmented rea-
soning strategy that enhances retrieved evidence through a dual-
channel mechanism. This approach not only supplements the aux-
iliary inputs but also enhances the model’s understanding of the
user query via semantic rephrasing.
Level-1: Evidence-based Contextualization. We first aggregate
auxiliary textual signals from 𝐴𝑠𝑡 . This aggregated context reflects
the explicit knowledge retrieved from the video content and acts
as grounded, observable evidence for reasoning.

(𝑖 ) }𝑘

This produces two outputs: a generated context Cgen and a set of
𝑘 semantically equivalent queries {Q
𝑖=1. These components en-
able the model to reason over both retrieved facts and inferred in-
tent.
Final Input Composition. The final structured input to the LVLM
integrates the sampled video frames, the retrieved auxiliary evi-
dence, the original query, and the generated latent context:

O = LVLM(𝐹𝑘𝑒𝑦, Concat(A𝑠𝑡 , Q, {Q

(𝑖 ) }𝑘

𝑖=1

, Cgen)).

(7)

RemaRK. By combining retrieval-grounded evidence with genera-
tive reasoning and query reformulation, this bi-level design strength-
ens both explicit and implicit context understanding. It also mitigates
alignment gaps between noisy auxiliary signals and the model’s pre-
trained knowledge space, resulting in more robust and semantically
coherent outputs.

4 Experiments
4.1 Datasets
We gauge the effectiveness of our framework on three publicly
accepted long-video testbeds. Video-MME [4] contains real-world
clips that run anywhere from 11 s to roughly one hour and probe
fine-grained understanding of everyday scenarios. MLVU [42] spans
nine evaluation tasks sourced from videos lasting 3 min to 2 h
(mean length about 12 min), challenging models to reason across
extended temporal ranges. Finally, LongVideoBench [33] targets
multimodal retrieval and reasoning in lengthy footage, offering
6,678 human-written multiple-choice questions distributed over 17
thematic categories.

4.2 Experimental Implementation
All experiments were executed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. At the first
stage, we prune the LVLM’s detection prompts, keeping only con-
crete, CLIP-responsive objects and discarding abstract terms. For
following retrieval, we fix both the FAISS and CLIP acceptance
thresholds to 0.3; FAISS scores are computed with the IndexFlatIP
backend [8]. Our ablation suite is built around Long-LLaVA 7B [35],
whose extended context window and modest footprint make it
ideal for probing how RAG similarity cut-offs and frame-sampling
rates affect performance.

candidate LVLM to the same 32-frame input budget, an especially
practical ceiling for the 72B-parameter models and a convenient
checkpoint for their 7B counterparts. Our benchmark therefore
covers six systems: four open 7B backbones (Video-LLaVA [12],
LLaVA-NeXT-Video [40], LongVA [39], Long-LLaVA [35]) and two
72B giants (Qwen2-VL [31], LLaVA-Video [41]). As reported in Ta-
ble 1, attaching TV-RAG to the 72B pair lifts their scores beyond
the proprietary Gemini-1.5-Pro baseline [25]. Averaged over all six
backbones, the pipeline delivers a significant gain, with the most
dramatic jumps on extended footage. The boost stems from inject-
ing ∼14 additional keyframes (about 2 000 tokens in total, given
the typical 144-token payload per frame), which compensates for
the weak visual grounding of LVLMs that were largely pre-trained
on text. These extra, text-rich frames act as semantic anchors and
enable sharper comprehension of complex video content.
MLVU. Table 2 contrasts leading LVLMs on the benchmark’s multiple-
choice split. The vanilla 7B LLaVA-Video line scores 70.8, but once
TV-RAG is attached, the figure climbs to 72.6, an absolute gain of
+1.8 that propels the small model ahead of every open-source rival
under 70B, including the 32B Oryx-1.5 (72.3). A similar but smaller
gain is observed for the 72B backbone, improving from 73.1 to 73.4
and further widening the gap with the proprietary GPT-4o base-
line (64.6). These improvements, achieved with the same 64-frame
budget, underline TV-RAG’s ability to supply complementary tex-
tual cues that sharpen video understanding, especially for lighter
models that still have headroom to benefit from richer context.
LongVideoBench. We next gauge the influence of TV–RAG on
both 7B and 72B LLaVA–Video backbones via the LongVideoBench
suite [33]. For clarity, we adopt the plain 64–frame feed and omit

climbs to the runner-up position on the validation leaderboard:
its score edges past Gemini-1.5-Pro [25] by 1.6% and trails GPT-
4o [22] by merely 1.1%. The lighter 7B model also profits, posting a
+2.2% uplift under the same experimental regime. These results un-

sequence. Taken together, these findings affirm the rationale be-
hind TV-RAG: multimodal retrieval, temporal alignment, and adap-
tive weighting converge to produce more faithful and grounded
video-language reasoning.

Figure 4: Qualitative result shown in Video-MME [4] bench-
mark when applying TV-RAG with LLaVA-Video [41].

Table 6 reports how the similarity cutoff 𝜏 shapes both efficiency
and accuracy when Long-LLaVA 7B answers the benchmark’s multiple-
choice questions. Lower bars (𝜏=0–0.1) flood the prompt with more
auxiliary tokens, pushing the inference time to 30-40 s but only
edge the overall score to 63-64. Raising the bar gradually prunes
redundant text and accelerates decoding; at 𝜏=0.3 the model pro-
cesses 1.9 K tokens in 13 s yet still logs 61.6 overall, while post-
ing the single best medium-clip accuracy (61.0). Beyond this point,
the gains erode: 𝜏=0.5 and 𝜏=1.0 shrink the token load to ≤ 0.3
K and time to ≤ 9 s, but overall correctness drops sharply to 56.7
and 52.5, respectively. Hence 𝜏=0.3 offers the most balanced trade-
off—halving latency relative to the lowest cutoffs, staying within
typical context limits ( ∼1.9 K extra tokens), and preserving strong
performance across clip lengths. For LVLMs with tighter windows,
a softer cutoff such as 𝜏=0.2 may be preferred, still keeping the to-
ken budget under 3 K while avoiding the steep accuracy loss seen
at stricter thresholds.

To study the effectiveness of our model, we compare it with
Video-RAG [18]. As shown in Table 5, our method demonstrates a
clear performance boost over Video-RAG across all video lengths.
This improvement is observed in both the Long-Video and LLaVA-
Video models, with particularly noticeable gains in handling shorter
and longer videos. Overall, our model contributes to better model
performance by effectively addressing the challenges posed by dif-
ferent video durations. The observed gains can be attributed to our
framework’s ability to integrate temporal semantics more adap-
tively.

budgets: 8, 16, 32, and 64 sampled frames. Figure 3 charts the ac-
curacies and reveals two clear trends. First, the retrieval layer de-
livers a measurable lift at every budget; second, the gap widens as
more frames are fed in, with the biggest jump on lengthy clips. In
the vanilla baseline (no retrieval), performance tops out at the 32-
frame mark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model.

We isolate each textual cue produced by the TV-RAG retriever,
including semantic-entropy weighting (SE), temporal-window gat-
ing (TW), OCR strings, ASR transcripts, and the context-enrichment
layer, and feed successive combinations to Long–LLaVA–7B [35].
Performance on Video-MME [4] (Table 4) climbs steadily with ev-
ery new source, with ASR and OCR delivering the significant jump
across short and long clips alike, confirming the unique value of
ASR and OCR transcripts.

SE (semantic-entropy) and TW (temporal-window) act as qual-
ity filters, discarding semantically weak or temporally mismatched
snippets so that only the most relevant text aligns with each frame

are visualized for the example in Figure 4. The combined visualization makes clear that the supplementary texts retrieved by
TV-RAG tighten the vision–language link: they redirect the network’s attention toward the frames most pertinent to the
question, thereby boosting both answer precision and contextual fidelity.

4.5 More Studies
We present more expriments for Video-MME [4] in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. As shown
in the figures, integrating external tools with LLaVA-Video to pro-
cess and retrieve extracted textual information from videos sig-
nificantly enhances the model’s ability to mitigate visual halluci-
nations. This integration leads to more accurate and contextually
grounded responses to user queries by reinforcing the alignment
between visual content and textual understanding.

Furthermore, the Grad-CAM [26] and t-SNE [30] visualization
results provide additional evidence supporting the impact of TV-
RAG in strengthening cross-modal alignment within the LVLM.

Specifically, the Grad-CAM results highlight improved attention to
semantically relevant regions in the video frames, while the t-SNE
analysis reveals a more structured representation space, indicating
a refined relationship between visual and textual modalities. These
findings collectively underscore the effectiveness of our approach
in enhancing the robustness and interpretability of LVLM-based
video understanding.

In summary, the qualitative examples not only highlight the cor-
rectness of predictions but also provide insight into how the model
reasons through retrieved information.

5 Conclusion
We propose TV-RAG, a training-free adaptor that upgrades long-
video reasoning in large vision-language models. The scheme fuses
two key ideas: (i) a sliding temporal window that aligns retrieved
cues with the correct time span and (ii) an entropy-based score
that favours semantically rich segments, together compensating
for the narrow temporal receptive field of standard LVLMs and for
their difficulty in tracing subtle scene-level shifts. Contrary to re-
trievers that rely purely on text similarity or pipelines that demand
full model fine-tuning, TV-RAG clips onto any existing backbone
as a light, plug-and-play module. Extensive trials on Video-MME,
MLVU, and LongVideoBench confirm marked gains, allowing the
patched models to overtake contemporary leaders such as Gemini-
1.5-Pro and GPT-4o in some metrics. The future work targets finer
temporal gating and adaptive entropy scaling to further strengthen
cross-modal alignment and deep contextual reasoning. In future
work, we will extend TV-RAG to dynamically adjust its temporal
window size based on content uncertainty and explore curriculum-
style retrieval schedules to better adapt to ultra-long, open-world
video streams. We also plan to generalise the framework to audio-
visual co-reasoning and egocentric or 360° footage, broadening its
applicability across emerging multimodal benchmarks.
